I'm currently an assistant professor in the [IQA group](https://iqa.telecom-paris.fr/) at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home). Previously I was working as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Omar Fawzi](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/omar.fawzi/index.html) at the [LIP, ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/). Before that I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Roger Colbeck](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/roger-colbeck/).

My CV can be found [here](/files/cv_pjb.pdf).
