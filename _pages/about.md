I'm currently an associate professor in the [QTY group](https://quriosity.telecom-paris.fr/) at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home). Previously I was working as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Omar Fawzi](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/omar.fawzi/index.html) at the [LIP, ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/). Before that I completed my PhD in Department of Mathematics at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/) under the supervision of [Roger Colbeck](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/roger-colbeck/).

Slides from the QCrypt 2024 tutorial can be found [here](/files/QCrypt_tutorial_final.pptx).

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in problems within *quantum information* with a particular interest in *device-independent cryptography* and *convex optimization*.
